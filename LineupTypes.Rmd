## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(ggrepel)
library(memisc)
library(plotly)
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
getwd()
setwd("c:/Users/Matt/My Documents/Draft Model/Position/Final")
getwd()
df <- read.csv('LineupCSV.csv')
df2 <- read.csv('AP.csv')
```

```{r}
f <- ggplot(df, aes(MP, PTS, color = Basic_Type)) + xlim(30, 1500) + ylim(-30, 45) +
  geom_point(aes(stat = Season, stat2 = Team, stat3 = PLAYER_NAMES), size = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Lineup Types", x = "Minutes Played", y = "Net Rating")

ggplotly(f)
```

```{r}
ggplot(df2, aes(Season, MP, color=Basic_Type, shape=League)) +
    geom_line(size=1) + geom_point(size=3) + 
  labs(title = "Growth of Small-ball", x = "Season", y = "% of Total Minutes")
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
